  <p> In 2025 I was lucky enough to go to Australia for 7 weeks. Its been a dream of mine to always go and due to my uncle going there for his sabbatical and saving my holiday time from work I was able to go for such a long period. I spent my time there in Brisbane, Queensland and I was there between February and April which was partly during their summer. </p>
  
  <h2> What did I see? </h2>
  
  <p> In terms of wild life I came across various animals I’ve never seen before such as....</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li id="Koalas"> Koalas </li>
    <li> Kangaroos </li>
    <li> Dingos </li>
    <li> Wombats </li>
    <li> Tasmanian Devils</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> While there are other species of lizards, spiders and snakes that I’ve also came across those were the animals worth noting. </p>
  
  <h3> Where did I travel? </h3>
  
  <p> Outside of Brisbane I spent some time in Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast within Queensland and later travelled to Sydney in New South Wales. </p>
  
  <h4> Would I ever go again? </h4>
  <p> Hopefully in a few years I can revisit the country and fully travel across its vast land, <strong> next time by car. </strong></p>
